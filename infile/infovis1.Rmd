## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo = TRUE}
dir <- c("/Users/cigom/Documents/GitHub/July_2018_bioinfo/infile/")
setwd(dir)
x <- read.table(paste0(dir,"diffExpr.P1e-2_C1.matrix"))
```
And read the input file; then let's make a `head(x)` from the file:

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
x <- read.table(paste0(dir,"diffExpr.P1e-2_C1.matrix2"))
library(knitr)
kable(head(x))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r x, fig.cap = "example 1", fig.align = "center", echo=TRUE}
library(superheat)
superheat(x,
          # retain original order of rows/cols
          pretty.order.rows = TRUE,
          pretty.order.cols = TRUE,
          row.dendrogram = TRUE,
          left.label = "none",
          bottom.label.text.angle = 0,
          row.title = "Differential Expressed",
          column.title = "Samples")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
